<p>In this article, I am going to cover the difference between Kaggle &amp; Real-world
projects.</p>

<p>And it’s not just about Kaggle but any data science competition or hackathon for
that matter…</p>

<p>Kaggle is a really good platform to get started with Data Science and even to
keep yourself updated with state-of-the-art algorithms and frameworks in data
science space.</p>

<p>But is it really enough to make you a real-world data scientist? Let’s find out…</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*M0maqWwfZvhdux0BlsecbA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>First of all, let’s have a look at the agenda today, we will see what Kaggle
platform looks like, how Kagglers compete there, what a typical real-world
project looks like.</p>

<p>A head-to-head comparison between Kaggle competitions and real-world data
science project, some general differences as well, and concluding thoughts
towards the end.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*n0KvaYtKXk_qGOHr_lku4w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Kaggle platform has five main sections, you can take part in competitions, some
sample competitions are also there for beginners.</p>

<p>You can take part in discussion forums, you can also have a look at kernels or
notebooks from other Kagglers to review their approach.</p>

<p>There is a dataset section as well, where you can hone your data skills by
munging &amp; exploring the dataset.</p>

<p>And if you are a complete beginner, you can find introductory to intermediate
level courses as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*4PcXvrF3Xe_GxkVCjhRBeA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In a Kaggle competition, you get a well-defined problem statement, with
evaluation and competition timelines.</p>

<p>You build a baseline, review others’ approaches if they have made their
notebooks public.</p>

<p>You can engage in discussion forums to understand the competition better.</p>

<p>Based on these findings, you iterate your data science pipeline until the
deadline.</p>

<p>You also get partially exposed test dataset to give you an idea of how good is
your solution.</p>

<p>There are public and private leaderboards, public leader-board is real-time and
based on the exposed part of test dataset, private leader-board is made public
after the end of the competition, which is based on the hidden part of the test
dataset.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*g767ElPhleXrrW_vSMtRoA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In a typical real-world project, you identify and evaluate the opportunity, you
develop a business understanding of the problem you are looking to solve.</p>

<p>You fetch, qualify and analyse available data, build a prototype or POC to get
the buy-in from project sponsors to convert it into a full-fledged solution or
product.</p>

<p>You follow CRISP-DM methodology to build the model, and deploy, host and monitor
the model in production.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*BDwdywD5vVXhw_bJVrsomQ.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In a head-to-head comparison, you can see that in Kaggle competitions, problem
statement is well-defined, while in real-world projects you may need to first
identify an opportunity and then formulate the problem statement.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, datasets are available, while in real-world, you need to identify and
fetch relevant data.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, Train-Test-Real datasets are already segregated, while in a
real-world project, you need to analyse what kind of split best suits for your
project.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, there are restrictions to using outside data, while in real-world,
you can keep looking for additional relevant data.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, evaluation criteria is already defined for you, while in real-world,
you need to explore which evaluation criteria suits the best for your use case.</p>

<p>There are differences between evaluation criteria and business KPIs, so you need
to be aware of and take care of that as well, I will talk about it in detail
later.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, you need to submit your results in a specific format, while in
real-world, you generally deploy and host the model for business stakeholders.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, you get a deadline for the competitions, while in real-world, you can
continue as long as the project has funds are there or project sponsor wants you
to.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*6TXmGuu2Sf_PZWzMH1hDsA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Now let’s have a look at the general differences.</p>

<p>In Kaggle competitions, you have a leader-board to know where you stand compared
to other participants, while in real-world projects, you are the best as long as
you are not challenged.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, the expectation is to move higher on the leader-board, while in
real-world, you need to manage the expectations of the project stakeholders.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, you can use all the resources you can, while in real-world you take
every decision with respect to its business value.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, competition timelines are important, in real-world, time to market is
an important aspect.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, you can collaborate with other participants to form a team, in
real-world, you and other team members need to develop a T-shaped skills-set.</p>

<p>Where horizontal line represents the data literacy shared across the team and
vertical line represents depth in a particular area.</p>

<p>Like a cloud engineer’s horizontal skill is his data literacy and the end-to-end
understanding of the work being done in the project, while his vertical skill is
cloud computing.</p>

<p>In Kaggle, models can be as complex as they can, in order to improve accuracy,
while in real-world, practical deployment aspects are also considered.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*dbHX09QD2JPLEqE7hqtfqg.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So what is the takeaway of this session?</p>

<p>In my view, Kaggle is a useful platform, provided it has other components as
well apart from competitions.</p>

<p>Real-world projects are different in many aspects as we discussed earlier.</p>

<p>Regarding the effectiveness of the Kaggle platform as a learning tool is really
subjective.</p>

<p>A data science beginner may find it very useful and can also use this platform
to showcase his skills.</p>

<p>While an experienced data scientist may not have enough time to take part in
live competitions.</p>

<p>Still, he can visit the platform intermittently to find any competition which
may relate to the real-world problem he is solving.</p>

<p>So this is it for now, I hope you found this episode useful. Let me know your
views in the comments section.</p>
