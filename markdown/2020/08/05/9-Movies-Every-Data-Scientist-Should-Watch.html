<p>I have been a movie buff all my life.</p>

<p>I have watched almost all the top 250 movies from IMDB and every decent movie
from my favourite genres.</p>

<p>Now, you may ask me how data science and movies are related.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Watch my episode on the same topic on YouTube
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXj421me3O0">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there are a few worth-watching movies on science &amp; technology, like
biographies, real-life events, sci-fi et Cetra.</p>

<p>Today, I would like to talk about 9 movies every data scientist should watch.</p>

<p>Please note, that these movies are not specific to data science, and I am
covering them in chronological order.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*LkJlf7-jfAJ1CphoBWOJkg.png" alt=""></p>

<p>First one in the list is ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’.</p>

<p>With a computer named HAL, the plot follows a voyage to the Jupiter, after the
discovery of an alien monolith.</p>

<p>This film deals with themes of human evolution, technology, artificial
intelligence, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever
made.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Zx6YsgPx4tWsVENcE9MRjw.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Second movie that you should watch is ‘A Beautiful Mind’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2001 biographical drama, directed by Ron Howard.</p>

<p>It is based on the life of the American mathematician John Nash, a Nobel
Laureate in Economics, and Abel Prize winner.</p>

<p>The plot covers Nash’s achievements in the field of Mathematics, despite
suffering from serious mental disorder.</p>

<p>The film was well received by critics, but has been criticized, for its
inaccurate portrayal of, some aspects of Nash’s life.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*I5ixP1V6D7ro4q2Tn0p-7w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The third movie in my list is ‘Minority Report’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2002 science fiction, directed by Steven Spielberg, and loosely
based on the 1956 short story, with the same name.</p>

<p>The plot is set in the year 2054, where PreCrime, a specialized police
department, apprehends criminals based on foreknowledge of the crimes to be
committed.</p>

<p>The film’s central theme is the question of ‘free-will’ versus ‘determinism’. It
examines whether free-will can exist if the future is known in advance.</p>

<p>It was one of the best-reviewed films of 2002 and was nominated for several
awards.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*A3V8rihTDebepJWxDTCpNw.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Next movie that I recommend is ‘Moneyball’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2011 biographical sports drama, directed by Bennett Miller.</p>

<p>The plot covers a baseball team’s 2002 season where their general manager
attempts to assemble a competitive team.</p>

<p>In the film, the manager faced with the limited budget for players, builds a
team of undervalued talent by taking a sophisticated sabermetric approach, to
scouting and analyzing players.</p>

<p>It achieved box office success and critical acclaim, particularly for its acting
and screenplay.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*0n7cbrSCvpNoVopjCXoV7Q.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Fifth movie in my list is ‘Her’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2013 science-fiction romantic drama, written, directed, and
produced by Spike Jonze.</p>

<p>The plot follows a man who develops a relationship, with an artificially
intelligent virtual assistant, personified through a female voice.</p>

<p>In a 2016 BBC poll of 177 critics around the world, it was voted the
84th-greatest film since 2000.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*VWfyVEPO2Jv_cKEukTLttw.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Another movie that I would like to mention is ‘Interstellar’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2014 epic science fiction, directed, co-written and co-produced
by Christopher Nolan.</p>

<p>Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, the plot
follows a group of astronauts, who travel through a wormhole near Saturn, in
search of a new home for humanity.</p>

<p>Interstellar received positive reviews for its screenplay, direction, visual
effects, musical score and acting.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*2Q0AsMdYx64ArRc23fBu-w.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Seventh movie that I would like you to watch is ‘The Theory of Everything’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2014 biographical romantic drama, directed by James Marsh.</p>

<p>Set at the University of Cambridge, it details the life of the theoretical
physicist Stephen Hawking.</p>

<p>This film is mainly about Jane Hawking, who deals with her relationship with
ex-husband Stephen Hawking, his diagnosis of nervous system disease, and his
success in the field of physics.</p>

<p>The film received positive reviews, with praise for the musical score,
cinematography, and the performances of protagonists.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*8CrYL-H-52rBtXLwLvLq2g.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Next movie in my list is ‘The Imitation Game’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2014 historical drama, directed by Morten Tyldum.</p>

<p>The plot revolves around the life of a British cryptanalyst Alan Turing, who
decrypted German intelligence messages, for the British government during the
2nd World War.</p>

<p>The title of the film quotes the name of the game Alan Turing proposed for
answering the question “Can machines think?”</p>

<p>The film was criticized by some for its inaccurate portrayal of historical
events, and for downplaying Turing’s homosexuality.</p>

<p>However, the LGBT community honoured it, for bringing Turing’s legacy to a wider
audience, with its subtle and realistic approach.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*drqD11hFhKfR7h2tZr10aA.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The last movie that you should consider to watch is ‘Blade Runner 2049’.</p>

<p>This film is a 2017 science fiction, directed by Denis Villeneuve.</p>

<p>As a sequel to the 1982 film Blade Runner, it narrates the story of synthetic
humans known as replicants.</p>

<p>In the film, Nexus-9 replicant known as “blade runner”, uncovers a secret that
threatens to destabilize society and the course of civilization.</p>

<p>The film was praised by critics for its performances, direction, cinematography,
musical score, production design, visual effects, and faithfulness to the
original film.</p>

<p>So this is my list of movies every data scientist should watch.</p>
