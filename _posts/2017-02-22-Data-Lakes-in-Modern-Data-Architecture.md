Data Lake (DL): a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed

Data Lakes will be central to the modern data architecture because of these features:

-   Agility: ability to convert data \>\> information \>\> action
-   Insight: ability to give business insights
-   Scalability: ability to accommodate data growth

**All data is welcome:**

-   Stores all type of data: structured, semi-structured & unstructured
-   Stores raw data in its original form for extended period of time
-   Uses various tools to correlate, enrich & query for the insights on the data
-   Provides democratized access via single unified view across the Enterprise

**Traditional Data Architecture**

Sources \>\> ETL \>\> EDW \>\> Data Discovery/Analytics/BI

**Modern Data Architecture**

Streaming/Unstructured/Various Sources \>\> Data Lake (Derived/Discovery Sandbox) \>\> EDW \>\> Data Science/Data Discovery/Analytics/BI

**Data Lake Challenges & Complications**

*In Building:*

-   Rate of change in data sources
-   Skill gap in the industry
-   Complexity involved in accommodating different data sources

*In Managing:*

-   Ingestion of different data sources
-   Lack of visibility for future requirements
-   Privacy & Compliance related

*In Delivering:*

-   Quality Issues with data
-   Reliance on IT
-   Reusability of data
