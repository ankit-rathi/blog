title: How I started my Data Science journey?

It was the end of 2012 as I remember, I was working with an MNC as a data architect. 

I was working all things data, from operational systems to data warehouse to business intelligence, end to end data pipeline in an enterprise. 

I started to have an impression that I know everything about data, and how it moves through the organization. 

One day, while browsing the internet, I came across an article named 'Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century'. 

I got surprised as well as intrigued, what is this? 

I heard the term for the first time and since an HBR article claimed it to be the job of the century, I thought of knowing more about it. 

After doing a little more digging, I came across 'Machine Learning' course by Andrew Ng, I finished it end to end in 3 months. 

Next challenge was to apply what I learnt… 

A little more digging got me to Kaggle platform, which used to host few competitions those days, I started playing with (now famous) Titanic problem, Housing Prices problem was added a bit later. 

So that's how I got into Data Science field, what is your story? 

I will cover in my upcoming posts, how I got my first Data Science project and went on to become a Kaggle Expert (very few that time).
