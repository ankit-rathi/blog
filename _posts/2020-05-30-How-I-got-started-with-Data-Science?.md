As many of you may know, I keep writing posts on LinkedIn and on my personal blog regularly on data & AI field.

The most frequently asked questions by my readers and followers are how I started with Data Science and how they can also get started, so let me cover the first question today.

It was the end of 2012 as I remember, I was working with an MNC as a data architect.

I was working all things data, from operational systems to data warehouse to business intelligence, a kind of end to end data pipeline in an enterprise.

I started to have an impression that I know everything about data, and how it moves through the organization.

One day, while browsing the internet, I came across an article named ‘Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century’.

I got surprised as well as curious, what is this? I heard the term for the first time and since an HBR article claimed it to be the job of the century, I thought of knowing more about it.

After doing a little more digging, I came across ‘Machine Learning’ course by Andrew Ng, I finished it end to end in 3 months.

Next challenge was to apply what I learnt…

A little more digging got me to Kaggle platform, which used to host few competitions those days, I started playing with (now famous) Titanic problem, and Housing Prices problem was added a bit later.

I am working as a Data & AI architect now, my primary responsibility is to infuse intelligence in existing products and identify new Data &AI use cases and build products around it.

I build quick prototypes and if all goes well I work with other data professionals (like data scientists, data engineers, cloud engineers, devops engineers etc) to deliver the product.

In my free time, I keep experimenting with latest tech-stack, write blog and books, deliver sessions over podcasts and youtube. I also conduct seminars and workshops on Data & AI, and serving as an advisory to several start-ups.

So that’s how I got into Data Science field, what is your story? Please let me know in the comment section.

So this was it, I will cover in my upcoming posts, how I got my first Data Science project and became a Kaggle Expert and why I stopped participating in Kaggle competitions.
